		<p> Hello! My name is <u>Walker Carraway</u>, I am a freshman at NCSU with the intended major of mechanical engineering. 
		I chose to persue mechanical engineering because of tbe job potential right out of college. For the last two years 
		I've been a mechanic working on British cars and for that reason I want to do a automotive concentration.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: Futura; color: #00ff00; font-size: 25px; font-alignment: center" > Like i previously mentioned, I've been a mechanic since my junior year of high school. I've worked on everything from 
		<i>Astin Martins</i> to <i>Bentlys</i>. I have had the opportunity to work on some truly insane cars that I've always loved. My all time favorite
		of all cars I've had to pleasure of working on is probably the <b>1969 Mustang Mach 1</b>. It's a classic.
